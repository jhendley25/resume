<h3>Skills (the most important stuff)</h3>


<p>I'm most proud of my project called GitHUD. It's an open-source project for viewing GitHub repository and user statistics in a meaningful way. After entering GitHub usernames, each user's repos are displayed as individual 'cards' of sorts, containing two main charts: a donut chart of contributors and their amount of contribution, as well as a line chart showing the weekly number of commits over the life of the repo. The full screen slideshow view provides an extended amount of information for users' repos such as recent commits, total additions/deletions, and the level of contributions by different open-source hackers.</p>

<h5>HTML/CSS/Jade/Skim</h5>

<p>I can mark up anything you throw my way. It will be pixle-perfect, guaranteed.</p>

<h4>SASS/Compass</h4>

<p>These preprocessors make styling not only more fun, but more sane.</p>

<h4>JavaScript/CoffeeScript</h4>

<ul>
<li>Backbone.js</li>
<li>JQuery</li>
<li>Underderscore</li>
<li>D3</li>
<li>Jade</li>
</ul>


<p>I dig heavy-duty Backbone work.</p>

<p>I've scratched the surface of Node.js, but as my instructor, Mason Stewart, will tell you, I'm a quick study and I have no qualms about being able to learn quickly and contribute to a team.</p>

<h5>Parse</h5>

<p>I've used Parse as a back end for most of my projects and am fully confident in my ability to build fully-functional JS apps connected to a database.</p>

<h5>Scaffolding tools</h5>

<ul>
<li>Yeoman, Grunt, Bower</li>
<li>HTML5 Boilerplate</li>
<li>jQuery Boilerplate</li>
</ul>


<h5>Testing tools</h5>

<ul>
<li>Jasmine</li>
<li>Mocha</li>
</ul>



<h3>What I did before becoming a developer</h3>

<p><strong>Crider &amp; Associates - Real Estate Appraiser</strong><br>
<em>March 2013 – Aug 2013</em></p>

<p>I learned the importance of paying attention to the details. Developing an accurate appraisal document isn't a walk in the park, and you have to be meticulous to get it right.</p>

<p>More importantly, it cut my teeth on what it's like to work in a growing business—the necessity of cash-flow, managing people, and how important it is to put together a solid, agile team.</p>

<p><strong>Climb Upstate - Manager</strong><br>
<em>Aug 2010 – Aug 2011</em></p>

<p>For all intents and purposes, I ran this business. Even though it was a small local company, I worked on marketing, developed community around the brand, and worked on developing new product offerings for the climbing gym.</p>

<p>I also served as the head route-setter, putting my problem solving skills to work developing really difficult routes for some of the top rock climbers in the region.</p>

<p><strong>IH Services - Maintenance crew supervisor</strong><br>
<em>Mar 2010 – Aug 2010 <br>
    Jan 2007 – Aug 2009</em></p>

<p>To be frank, I learned the value in doing the work that no-one else wants to do. I lead a cleaning crew, and it wasn't glamorous. We cleaned industrial buildings, from floors to toilets.</p>

<p>This job taught me to rally a crew to do the work that needed to be done.</p>

<h3>Education</h3>

<p><strong>The Iron Yard Academy</strong><br>
<em>August 2013 - November 2013</em></p>

<p>This was the best three months of my life. It took me from zero to hero. I started knowing only basic HTML/CSS, and ended up developing an open-sourced tool called GitHUD that utilizes GitHub's API to display open-source repository and user statistics in a meaningful way. <a href="http://github.com/jhendley25/GitHUD">Check it out here.</a></p>

<p><strong>Colorado Technical University</strong><br>
<em>Fall 2011 – Fall 2012</em></p>

<p>I studied marketing and business.</p>

<p><strong>National Outdoor Leadership School</strong><br>
<em>Aug 2009 – Sep 2009</em></p>

<p>I graduated as part of the Rocky Mountain Educator program.</p>
