<h3>Why I was born to be a web developer</h3>

<p>I've always loved working with technology and have been drawn to making it do what I want. Problem solving has always been second-nature to me. I realized this when I started rock climbing. Putting pieces together and determining the correct order of things to get to the desired outcome just always felt <em>right</em>.</p>

<p>Here's how I became a front end dev:</p>

<p>In september of 2012, I sustained a serious injury while rock climbing in California.  Shortly after, I returned to my hometown of Greenville, South Carolina, to recuperate and pursue a somewhat less (physically) risky career.</p>

<p>After a few months of recovering, I began a working as a Real Estate Appraiser and   learned that I needed to be doing something with code in order to enjoy my career.</p>

<p>In June of 2013, I happened upon an article describing the JavaScript Program at the Iron Yard Academy in Greenville. After working with JS, Backbone.js and JQuery in particular, I realized that I could bend the internet to my will, and I knew I'd found my calling.</p>

<p>Even though I'm a little green, the people who run The Iron Yard have confirmed that I'm one of the top students to graduate from their program and would be an incredibly valuable asset to any team pushing the boundaries on front end engineering.</p>

<p>I am confident that I'd be a valuable addition to the Typeform team, and am extremely excited about working crazy-long startup hours beside an amazing team. I'm also excited about sharing a few pints with great people when we're not cranking out code.</p>
